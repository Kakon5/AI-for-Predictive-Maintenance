## 🔍 Overview

This project outlines a theoretical framework for integrating AI into a smart factory environment to enable:

- **Real-time anomaly detection** in machine operations
- **Predictive maintenance** using historical sensor data
- **Proactive decision-making** to reduce unplanned downtime, improve quality, and increase overall equipment effectiveness (OEE)

The concept is inspired by real-world factory digitalization needs, such as those at **Aira**, a heat pump manufacturer.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Modern factories rely on complex systems like **motors, pumps, conveyors**, and robotic tools. Failures in these systems often lead to:

- Delayed detection of quality or mechanical issues
- Unplanned breakdowns
- High costs from reactive maintenance and scrap

## 🧠 AI-Based Solution Concept

The proposed solution is divided into two integrated modules:

### 1. **Anomaly Detection (Unsupervised)**

- Learn normal machine behavior using historical sensor data
- Detect deviations from normal patterns
- Classify anomalies as noise, minor deviations, or potential failures

### 2. **Predictive Maintenance (Supervised)**

- Use labeled anomaly data to train machine learning models
- Predict **failure likelihood**, **failure type**, or **time-to-failure (RUL)**
- Support **maintenance scheduling** before failures occur
